Hi, I'm Tyler Gorton, a senior at Iowa State University pursuing a double major in Software Engineering and Philosophy.
I'm also an amateur full-stack developer looking for a place to start my career after I graduate this spring. By _amateur_,
I don't just mean "unpaid" but rather the older definition: ["for the love of it"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amateur#did-you-know). 

<!--Today, the word _amateur_ is typically defined simply as "unpaid", and it often comes with the negative connotation of 
being unskilled, having failed and fallen short of "professional". Originally, though, the word comes from the latin verb _amare_, meaning "to love" — an amateur is someone who does something for **the love of it**. I prefer that meaning, and it's the one I use when I describe myself as an amateur. I develop software for the love of it, regardless of whether I also get paid for it.-->
<!--
I originally decided to pursue a future in software when I was in middle school, shortly after my first programming experience.
I had hoped to become a video game developer, as that was the medium that brought me the most happiness as a consumer. However,
as I grew and matured, especially through my time in college, my hobbies and interests diverged greatly from what they were in
middle school-->
