I'm Tyler Gorton, a senior at Iowa State University studying Software Engineering and Philosophy.
I'm also an amateur full-stack developer looking for a place to start my career after I graduate this spring. By _amateur_,
I don't mean "unpaid" but rather the older definition: ["for the love of it"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amateur#did-you-know). I love building software, and I strive to create software that people love to use. 

I decided to pursue a future in software engineering when I was in 8th grade, after having my first taste of development
with [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/). I was arguably more of a nerd back then, so my initial dream was
to be a video game developer, since gaming was my main hobby. Today, I'm more interested in software and technology
that highlights the beauty of the real world over trying to create alternative digital ones — though I do still enjoy 
some gaming.

Outside the realm of computers, I love hanging out with my friends & family and try to spend as much time with them as
I can. That usually involves playing games, watching movies, and going out camping, hiking, and especially climbing.
